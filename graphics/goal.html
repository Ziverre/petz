    In general, the goal with re-implementing the Petz graphics co-exists of:
    <ul>
        <li>1. Keep the spirit of original Petz graphics while allowing more flexibility for the modders (hexers as the community has coined)</li>
        <li>2. Make use of modern technology (hardware acceleration instead of software rendering)</li>
        <li>3. Address the flaws of how certain things are rendered in original games (e.g eyelids)</li>
        <li>4. Add certain features that are missing in original Petz</li>
    </ul>
